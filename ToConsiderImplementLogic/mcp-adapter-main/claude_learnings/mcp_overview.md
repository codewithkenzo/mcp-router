# Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication protocol that enables language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and data sources in a secure, controlled manner. Key characteristics:

- Client-host-server architecture
- Built on JSON-RPC 2.0
- Focused on context exchange and tool orchestration
- Enables composition of multiple specialized tools

## Core Components

1. **Host**: The application that coordinates multiple clients and manages AI integration.
2. **Clients**: Each client connects to a single MCP server and manages the stateful session.
3. **Servers**: Specialized services that expose resources, tools, and capabilities.

## Key Concepts

### Tools

Tools are functions that an LLM can call to perform actions, such as:
- Querying databases
- Managing files
- Calling external APIs
- Performing computations

Each tool has:
- A unique name
- A description
- An input schema (JSON Schema format)
- The ability to return multi-modal results (text, images, embedded resources)

### Resources

Resources provide context to LLMs, such as:
- Files
- Database schemas
- Application-specific information
- API documents

Each resource has:
- A unique URI
- Optional metadata (name, description)
- A MIME type
- Content (text or binary)

### Protocol Messages

MCP uses three message types:
- **Requests**: Methods with parameters expecting responses
- **Responses**: Results or errors matching specific request IDs  
- **Notifications**: One-way messages requiring no response

### Capability Negotiation

Clients and servers declare their supported features during initialization, establishing:
- Which tools are available
- Whether resources can be subscribed to
- Support for notifications
- Additional protocol extensions

## Security Model

- Each server operates in isolation with focused responsibilities
- Servers receive only necessary contextual information
- Full conversation history stays with the host
- Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host
- Security boundaries are enforced by the host process

## Why MCP Matters

1. **Decoupled Architecture**: Servers handle specific capabilities while hosts manage orchestration
2. **Composability**: Multiple specialized servers can be combined seamlessly
3. **Security**: Strict isolation between servers and controlled access to context
4. **Extensibility**: Progressive feature adoption with backward compatibility
5. **Standardization**: Common protocol for tool integration across different LLM platforms

## Using MCP in Python Applications

The mcp-adapter package provides Python bindings for:
- Connecting to MCP servers
- Orchestrating multiple servers
- Adapting LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini) to use MCP tools
- Building custom workflows with MCP capabilities
