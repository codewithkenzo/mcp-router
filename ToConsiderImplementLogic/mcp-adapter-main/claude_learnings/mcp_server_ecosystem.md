## Server Architecture

Regardless of implementation language, MCP servers follow a consistent pattern:
1. Implement the MCP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0)
2. Expose capabilities during initialization
3. Provide tools and/or resources
4. Handle requests and send responses/notifications

## Deployment Options

MCP servers can be deployed in various ways:
- NPX/NPM packages for JavaScript/TypeScript servers
- Python packages (via pip/uvx) for Python-based servers
- Docker containers for isolated execution
- Local executables for desktop integration

## Discovery & Management

Several tools exist to find and manage MCP servers:
- mcp-cli: Command-line inspector
- mcp-get: Server installation tool
- mcp-manager: Web UI for server management
- PulseMCP, Smithery: Registries of available servers

## Security Considerations

When using MCP servers, remember:
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper access controls
- Rate limit operations
- Sanitize outputs
- Get user confirmation for sensitive actions
