# MCP Best Practices Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines best practices for working with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem using the Python `mcp-adapter` package. It is designed to help developers create robust, maintainable applications that leverage LLMs with MCP servers effectively.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Client Initialization and Management

```python
# Initialize client with descriptive name and proper logging
client = MCPClient(
    server_params,
    debug=True,
    log_file=Path("logs") / "client.log",
    client_name="filesystem"  # Descriptive name helps with debugging
)

# Always use a try/finally pattern to ensure client closure
try:
    # Client operations
    pass
except Exception as e:
    client.logger.end_session("failed")
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
finally:
    await client.close()  # Critical for clean termination
```

### 2. Tool Management Pattern

```python
# Get tools from client
tools = await client.get_tools()

# Create tool collection for organizing multiple clients' tools
tool_collection = MCPTools()
tool_collection.add(tools)

# When using with LLMs
await llm.prepare_tools(tool_collection)
```

### 3. Safe Tool Execution Pattern

```python
# Send message to LLM to get tool call
response = await llm.send_message(prompt)
tool_name, tool_args = llm.extract_tool_call(response)

# Always validate tool calls before executing
if tool_name and tool_args:
    result = await client.execute_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
    print(f"Tool execution result: {result}")
else:
    print("Failed to extract valid tool call")
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Handle Tool Call Failures**:
   - Always check if `tool_name` and `tool_args` are valid before use
   - Implement appropriate fallbacks if tool calls fail

2. **Proper Exception Handling**:
   - Use specific exception types rather than bare `except` blocks
   - Log detailed error information to aid debugging
   - Implement graceful recovery where possible

3. **Session Management**:
   - Use `client.logger.end_session("completed")` or `client.logger.end_session("failed")` 
   - This ensures proper status tracking in logs

4. **Client Closure**:
   - Always close clients in a `finally` block to prevent resource leaks
   - Even if an operation fails, ensure proper cleanup

## Working with Multiple MCP Servers

1. **Consistent Initialization**:
   - Use same patterns for all server initialization
   - Group initialization code for better readability

2. **Tool Separation**:
   - Keep track of which tools come from which servers
   - Handle cases where tools might have name collisions

3. **Cross-Server Operations**:
   - When operations span multiple servers, validate each step
   - Handle partial failures gracefully

## LLM Integration Tips

1. **Clear and Specific Prompts**:
   - Make prompts that are likely to generate valid tool calls
   - Include specific parameters needed for tool execution

2. **Multi-Step Operations**:
   - Break complex operations into manageable steps
   - Validate success before proceeding to next step

3. **Adapting Different LLMs**:
   - Different LLMs may require different prompting styles
   - Test with multiple model providers when possible
   - Adjust prompts based on model capabilities

## Code Organization

1. **Module Structure**:
   - Group related functionality in logical modules
   - Separate client initialization from business logic

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Use environment variables or config files for keys, paths, etc.
   - Load configuration early and validate

3. **Typing and Documentation**:
   - Use type hints for better code readability
   - Document function parameters and return values
   - Add descriptive docstrings to modules and functions

## Performance Optimization

1. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel tool execution when possible
   - Parallelize independent operations for better performance

2. **Connection Reuse**:
   - Reuse clients instead of creating new ones for each operation
   - Initialize all clients at application start

3. **Session Management**:
   - Consider lifespan of client connections
   - Balance between long-lived sessions and resource usage

## Example Application Architecture

A typical MCP-based application follows this architecture:

1. **Initialization Layer**:
   - Client setup, configuration loading
   - Tool preparation

2. **Orchestration Layer**:
   - Coordinates operations across multiple servers
   - Handles execution flow and dependencies

3. **LLM Integration Layer**:
   - Translates business requirements to tool calls
   - Processes LLM responses

4. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Implements application-specific functionality
   - Makes decisions based on tool results

5. **User Interface Layer**:
   - Presents results to users
   - Collects user inputs

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Simple**:
   - Begin with a single MCP server integration
   - Add additional servers as needed

2. **Incremental Testing**:
   - Test each server integration independently
   - Verify tool extraction and execution at each step

3. **Error Identification**:
   - Use detailed logging to diagnose issues
   - Check server-side errors in log files

4. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Start with basic functionality and add features
   - Refine prompts through iterative testing

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build robust, maintainable applications using the MCP ecosystem. Remember that the key strengths of MCP lie in its ability to:

1. Separate concerns across specialized servers
2. Provide a consistent interface for tool execution
3. Enable secure, modular AI-powered applications
4. Allow composition of multiple capabilities

By leveraging these strengths while following development best practices, you can create powerful AI applications that are both maintainable and extensible.
