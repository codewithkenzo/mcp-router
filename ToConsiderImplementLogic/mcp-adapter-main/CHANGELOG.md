- time_example.py example showing Time MCP server integration
- Added claude_learnings directory with detailed MCP analysis documents for education
- Added comprehensive test suite with 47 passing tests
  - Unit tests for core/tools.py, core/client.py, core/logger.py, core/orchestrator.py
  - Unit tests for LLM adapters (base, OpenAI, Gemini)
  - 90% code coverage across the codebase
- Added run_tests.sh script that generates TEST_REPORT.md with date/time and coverage stats
- Updated tips_for_future_claude.md with testing best practices

### Fixed
- Standardized error handling across examples
- Improved docstrings and comments for better code documentation
- Added proper client closure in finally blocks for all examples
- Fixed unused variables and bare except blocks
- Added tool call validation before execution
- Improved TypeScript type annotations and return type consistency
- Fixed issues with async function testing
- Fixed test compatibility issues with different LLM adapters

### Notes for MCP Learners
- MCP adapter provides a clean way to integrate multiple specialized servers into Python applications
- Examples demonstrate the pattern of:
  1. Initialize MCP clients
  2. Get tools from clients
  3. Combine tools in MCPTools
  4. Configure LLM adapter with tools
  5. Use LLM to generate tool calls
  6. Execute tool calls on appropriate clients
- The research_assistant.py example shows how to build practical applications combining multiple servers (Filesystem + Memory)
- Error handling is critical - always close clients properly in finally blocks
- Always validate tool call results before executing them
- Knowledge graph capabilities in the Memory server enable building sophisticated relationship-based applications
- Proper testing helps ensure reliability of MCP integrations
- Use AsyncMock for testing async functions
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage in your test suite
